The goal of Partuza is to enable gadget developers to develop on their own system or private network,
and to serve as an example / starting point for websites who want to learn how to use php-shindig
to become OpenSocial containers.

To make sure this code can serve the later purpose, I'm licensing the code under 3 different Open Source
licenses, your free to pick the one that fits your project best.

Please do be aware that if you select one of these 3 licenses, you have to abide by it's specific terms!

Licenses availble:

APLv2 : Apache License (v2)
GPLv2 : Gnu Public License (v2)
GPLv3 : Gnu Public License (v3)

When in doubt what license suites you best, the default and assumed license is the APLv2 license.
